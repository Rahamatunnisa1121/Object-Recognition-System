# COCO Object Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **object recognition system** using the **COCO dataset**, a large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. The system utilizes deep learning models to detect and classify objects in images.

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The dataset follows the **COCO format** and consists of:
- **Annotations Folder** (`.json` files): Contains metadata like bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and object categories.
- **Image Folder**: Stores images corresponding to the annotations.
- **Categories**: Different object classes labeled with unique category IDs.
- **Annotations**: Each image can contain multiple annotated objects, leading to **more annotations than images**.
